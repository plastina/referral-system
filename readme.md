This system was created with to award clients that give their referral codes to new clients after these people make a purchase on store.

This is the result: https://github.com/plastina/referral-system


## Stack used

**Back-end:** JS, Node, Express and MySQL.

## Learnings

With this project, I improved my skills on the backend as I was able to better understand how a reward system works for customers after a certain amount of purchase. I also aim to create an interface using React for better visualization of the project.
